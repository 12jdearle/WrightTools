	     abstract = "I describe a colour scheme that is appropriate for the screen display of intensity images. This -- unlike many currently available schemes -- is designed to be monotonically increasing in terms of its perceived brightness. Also, when printed on a black and white postscript printer, the scheme results in a greyscale with monotonically increasing brightness. This scheme has recently been incorporated into the radio astronomical analysis packages CASA and AIPS."}
